## history to code a list of code snippits.

# formatting script is a bit manual at this point
# Saved history in RStudio at least does not preserve user indentation
# User may use savehistory(file = "my_history.R") to recall history, or send history manually from history pane to .R File
# then w/ .R script of interest open, restore indentation (and get a lot of other nice formatting) via rstudioapi::executeCommand("reformatCode")
# or Code -> Reformat Code from RStudio GUI
# then indentation will be ready for {memory}'s parsing
formatted_history_script <- "./ggplots_script.R"

# looks for pipelines starting with gg*
my_ggplots_code <- r_code_extract_ggplots_code_list(script_path = formatted_history_script)

my_ggplots_code

# parses code based on indentation. Code breaks are before non-indented lines
